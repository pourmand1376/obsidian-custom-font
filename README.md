# Obsidian Custom Font Plugin

Spice up your Obsidian notes with custom fonts! This plugin is created since currently obsidian doesn't support setting custom fonts easily. This is the case, especially in Android and IOS.

## Compatibility

This plugin leverages base64 encoding to ensure maximum compatibility across platforms. The chosen font will work on all operating systems (Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, and IOS).

So no matter what device you use Obsidian on, you can customize your notes with unique font styles! This way you won't even need to install the font on your operating system. 

## To get started

- Add your font files (.woff, .ttf, and .woff2) to your vault's `.obsidian/fonts` folder. 
- Open the plugin settings and choose your desired font from the dropdown menu.
- The selected font will now be applied across your entire vault. You can switch fonts anytime.

## Key Features

- Supports .woff, .ttf, and .woff2. 
- Simple settings menu to pick your font. Change it up anytime.
- Applies chosen font globally to your entire vault.
- Tested with a wide range of fonts for full compatibility.
- Custom CSS Style Support: You can apply the font to anywhere you want!
- Ability to set custom font on specific pages (See [#7](https://github.com/pourmand1376/obsidian-custom-font/issues/7))

## Issues and Pull-Requests

This idea of this plugin just recently came into my mind. I don't know what features would be useful to you. Issues and pull requests are highly appreciated.
