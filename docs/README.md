# Font to Base64 CSS Converter

A web-based tool that converts font files (.woff, .ttf, .woff2, .otf) to base64-encoded CSS for use with Obsidian. This tool extracts the core font conversion functionality from the [Obsidian Custom Font Plugin](https://github.com/pourmand1376/obsidian-custom-font) and makes it available as a standalone web application.

## Why Use This Tool?

This web-based converter is perfect for:
- Users who only need font conversion without the full plugin
- Those experiencing performance issues with the complete plugin
- Quick one-time font conversions
- Users who prefer lightweight solutions

## Technical Details

The converter uses the same core logic as the Obsidian Custom Font Plugin:
- Reads font files as ArrayBuffer
- Converts to base64 encoding
- Generates proper CSS @font-face declarations
- Provides appropriate MIME types for each font format

## Privacy

All processing happens locally in your browser. Font files are never uploaded to any server, ensuring your fonts remain private and secure.
